 The logic behind computer and resale shop is relatively easy to understand. I spent a lot of time on trying to figure out how to use class and when to add self before an obejct. I think this is the most difficult part, because if you accidentally miss the self before an object, the whole program wouldn't work. It would be helpful if someone tell me to review class before doing this assignment.
